# Phase 1: Foundations (Months 1-4)
Phase 1: Foundations Summary
The goal of Phase 1 (Months 1-4) is to establish a strong foundation in basic data structures, sorting algorithms, and fundamental problem-solving techniques. Over this period, you'll explore essential topics such as arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, hashing, recursion, and backtracking.

Expected Outcomes:

1. Deep understanding of array and string operations, including traversal, manipulation, and sorting.
2. Mastery of linked lists and stacks, focusing on core operations like insertions, deletions, and recursion-based problem-solving.
3. Proficiency in queues, hash maps, and basic searching techniques, with real-world applications.
4. Strong grasp of recursive thinking and backtracking, enabling efficient problem-solving for complex algorithmic challenges.
By the end of this phase, you'll have solved numerous problems on platforms like LeetCode, preparing you for more advanced topics.

### Array
concepts:
 `1. Basic Array Declaration and Initialization`
 ```C ++ Example Code:
 #include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
  int numbers [7] = {2, 4, 4, 9, 4, 5, 10 };
  for(int i = 0; i<7; i++){
    cout << numbers[i] << endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
 ```
